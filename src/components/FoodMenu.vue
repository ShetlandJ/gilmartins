        <h3>Our food and drink</h3>
        <h4><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/gilmartinsbakery/menu">THE MENU</a></h4>
        <p>At Gilmartin’s we cook from scratch and serve delicious fresh food from the best Ayrshire producers we can find. This might sometimes mean it takes a little longer to reach your table, but you know it’s fresh as can be.</p>
        <p>We believe in low food milage, and so we source as much of our food as close to our premises as possible.</p>
        <p>We don't buy in any cakes, bread, or prepared lunches. Everything is made and assembled in our kitchen.</p>
